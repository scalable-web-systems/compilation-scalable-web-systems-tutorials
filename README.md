(02/17/2022)
5. [Caching, Redis](https://github.com/scalable-web-systems/cache-2) - This tutorial is the second tutorial in the caching series. It focuses on integration of Redis into the docker-compose script and the usage of the corresponding npm package. (02/17/2022)
6. [Mongo DB, Replica Sets](https://github.com/scalable-web-systems/mongodb-replicaset) - The objective of this tutorial is to examine the concepts of high availability, reliability and redundancy by learning about MongoDB replica sets and working through a very basic example. (02/24/2022)
7. [Mongo DB, Sharding](https://github.com/scalable-web-systems/mongodb-sharding) - This tutorial focuses on sharding in databases, and its applications. A Docker+MongoDB example is used to illustrate the concept. (02/24/2022)
8. [Typescript Installation and Setup](https://github.com/scalable-web-systems/typescript-node) - This tutorial focuses on how to integrate typescript into a node project and demonstrates a working example of a minimal express server written using typscript. (02/25/2022)
9. [Event Driven Architecture, Node JS, Typescript & Docker](https://github.com/scalable-web-systems/eventbus-1) - This tutorial is focused on event driven architecture. (03/11/2022)
10. [Event Driven Architecture, Redis](https://github.com/scalable-web-systems/eventbus-2) - This tutorial uses Redis to demonstrate implementation of the event driven architecture. (03/11/2022)
11. [Typescript Basics](https://github.com/scalable-web-systems/typescript-basics)* - This tutorial covers the fundamentals of typescript - type annotations, type declarations, classes as types, object types, tuple types, intersection types, generic types. (03/24/2022)
12. [Express Basics](https://github.com/scalable-web-systems/express-nodejs) - This tutorial focuses on Javascript's minimal API framework Express and teaches how to create a basic server using Express. (03/30/2022)
13. [Unit Testing using Jest, Basics](https://github.com/scalable-web-systems/unit-testing-basics) - This tutorial explains the importance of unit testing and goes over how to write basic unit tests with typescript using Jest. It also explains how to install and configure Jest to work with typescript. (04/10/2022)
14. [Unit Testing, Mocking with Substitute](https://github.com/scalable-web-systems/unit-testing-mocking) - This tutorial explains mocking and it's utility in writing unit tests. Fluffyspoon's **Substitute** is used to illustrate the concept.

**Note:** The tutorials marked with an asterik have incomplete documentation and need some polishing.
